# Hi there 👋 I'm Patrick Kimanthi

I'm a Python developer and data engineer passionate about extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. I specialize in building robust web scrapers, ETL pipelines, and backend systems that power data-rich applications.

Currently, I work remotely with Appsonpoint, contracting for DocketAlarm (U.S.), where I build production-grade crawlers to structure legal data from diverse U.S. court systems.
